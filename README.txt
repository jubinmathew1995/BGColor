BGCOLOR 

It is a Windows form application made in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.
----
This application sets the background colour according to the RGB code provided by the user. 
RGB values varies in the range of 0 to 255. Entering values other than the specified values raises a error or
it doesnot set the specified colour to the background and the background colour remains the same.
----
In second commit added a new "Reset" Button which resets the background to its original colour.
